🪨 Rock vs Mine Prediction
This machine learning project predicts whether a sonar signal corresponds to a Rock (R) or Mine (M) using a logistic regression classifier trained on frequency-based sonar return data.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the Sonar Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing:

208 samples

60 features (numerical values representing sonar signal strength)

1 target column:

R → Rock

M → Mine

📁 Features
Each row contains 60 numeric attributes representing the energy of sonar signals bounced off a surface or object.

🧪 Libraries Used
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

🧠 Model
Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Train-Test Split: 90% training, 10% testing

Accuracy:

Training: ~83.4%

Testing: ~76.2%
